# Pretty Commit

![Pretty Commit Overview](/static/readme.png)

Explore the history of a GitHub repository, viewing its commits, associated files, and the content of individual files, all with a sleek, user-friendly interface.

Built entirely with Go for front end and back end. Uses Tailwind CSS for styling and HTMX for AJAX-like partial page updates without needing JS. Only external dependency is godotenv which is only for local testing.
